WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net ShiftReader/clock is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   650 out of   1,430   45%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       116 out of   2,860    4%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,137
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           555 out of   2,137   25%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              91 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
